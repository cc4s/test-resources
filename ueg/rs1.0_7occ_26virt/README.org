Note: the content of this directory will be removed. We will use two
Coulomb Vertex from vasp instead, with real and complex integrals.
However, the system will be the same

ueg (uniform electron gas) model system for the density rs=1.0 A simple cubic
box is evalauted with a volume of 58.6430628670.  The energy of the highest
occupied orbital is 0.3111615073.  The energy of the lowest unoccupied orbital
is 2.3232452653.  The total HF energy is 8.4914806035.  The zero momentum
integral is given with the madelung constant, which is 0.7302966760 for the
given volume. Further details can be found in
[[https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4867783][Coupled cluster channels in
the homogeneous electron gas]] Atomic units are used throughout.

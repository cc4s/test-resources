* r-BN solid in a natural orbital basis

This system corresponds to a periodic supercell of rhombohedral boron nitride (r-BN)
computed with =VASP=.
The =CC4S= input files have been created using the  =./run_vasp.sh= script provided in this directory.

The following files for the =CC4S= calculations are provided.
- CoulombVertex ::
  - =./CoulombVertex.yaml=
  - =./CoulombVertex.dat=
  These files were obtained using a singular value decomposition of the
  Coulomb Vertex in a plane-wave basis. See [[https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4977994][Low rank factorization of the Coulomb integrals for periodic coupled cluster theory]]
  for a detailed description.
- EigenEnergies ::
  - =./EigenEnergies.yaml=
  - =./EigenEnergies.dat=

To compute the finite-size correction for the CCSD correlation energies based on the
electronic transition structure factor interpolation approach, outlined in
[[https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.8.021043][Applying the Coupled-Cluster Ansatz to Solids and Surfaces in the Thermodynamic Limit]], the following files are needed.
- CoulombVertexSingularVectors ::
  - =./CoulombVertexSingularVectors.yaml=
  - =./CoulombVertexSingularVectors.dat=
  This file contains the transformation matrix from the auxiliary field to the plane-wave basis.
- GridVectors ::
  - =./GridVectors.yaml=
  - =./GridVectors.dat=
  This file contains information about the plane-wave basis vectors.
- CoulombPotential ::
  - =./CoulombPotential.yaml=
  - =./CoulombPotential.dat=
  This file contains the Coulomb potential employed for the calculation of the Coulomb Vertex.

To compute the basis-set incompleteness error correction for the CCSD correlation energy
based on the focal-point approach outlined in [[https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/5.0050054][Focal-point approach with pair-specific cusp correction for coupled-cluster theory]],
the following files are needed.
- DeltaIntegrals(ij) ::
  - =DeltaIntegralsHH.dat=
  - =DeltaIntegralsHH.yaml=
- DeltaIntegrals(abij) ::
  - =DeltaIntegralsPPHH.dat=
  - =DeltaIntegralsPPHH.yaml=
- Mp2PairEnergies ::
  - =Mp2PairEnergies.dat=
  - =Mp2PairEnergies.yaml=
  This file contains the MP2 electron-pair correlation energies extrapolated to the
  complete basis set limit.

* H2O2 calculated with MRCC

The cc4s input files are obtained by using a MRCC using a de-facto unmodified
version (as released march 2022).  The input file (MINP) can be seen in the
stdout (mrcc.stdout).

In addition, the standard output  of an FNO calculation using 4 frozen natural
orbitals (FNOs) per occupied orbital is provided.  (mrcc.fno.out). Note: This
calculation was performed using a local version of MRCC, with only minor
modifications made to allow setting the number of FNOs per occupied orbital (as
MRCC natively permits only selection via occupation numbers).


The following files for the =CC4S= calculations are provided.
- FOCK
- MOCOEF
- TEDAT
- TEINT
- mrcc.stdout

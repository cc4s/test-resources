* N2 molecule in cc-pvdz basis from the HEAT benchmark set

This system contains a N2 molecule calculated with the code
=NWCHEM= using Gaussian-type orbitals. Input and Output files
can be found in the present directory: input.nw and mp2.out.
For the same system CCSDT-1b and CCSDT-3 results are calculated
using the =CFOUR= program package for comparison - standard output
can be found in the files ccsdt-1b.out and ccsdt-3.out.

Furthermore, the energies can be compared with results from
Rishi and Valeev (https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5097150)

Correlation energies for ccsdt, dcsdt, and 3cc are not provided by Rishi and Valeev.
Hence, the provided numbers are obtained by taking their total energies and substracting
the MP2 result fromn wchem.


Note:
The larger discrepancies in Rishi's values arise because their energies are
reported with only five digits after the decimal point.

The agreement between =CC4s= and =CFOUR= for CCSDT is again better than 6e-8.
CCSDT@CFOUR: -0.321300223
